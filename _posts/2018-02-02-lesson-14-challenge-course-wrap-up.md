## :tada::tada: Hooray!! :tada::tada:

Wow! Three months have passed and we are at the end of the first phase of the Schoolarship. Through this weeks we have learned a lot about Android and about programming and software engineering in general. And the best part of it was the *awesome* community of passionated developers that this schoolarship have created and which I am proud to be part of.

The Android SDK is a wide and complex framework, but it deserves every minute we spend learning it, and after these three months we have just scratched the surface. We have learned how to create an Android app from scratch, from connecting it to Internet (in an efficient way :wink:) to get our data from any API we want to save it locally in the device for offline use, to create beautiful and complex User Interfaces and to send useful notifications to our app users.

But there is a lot more to learn, the list of things to learn grows quickly and we have to keep doing stuff to upgrade and to take our knowledge to the next level. Things that come to my mind are:

- Of course deepen in the SDK internals.
- Architectural Patterns like MVP, MVVM.
- General design patterns.
- Testing.
- Learn about the Gradle build system, flavors, variants and Proguard.
- Lot of UI realted stuff such as animations and VectorDrawables.
- Android Architecture Components, like ViewModel, Room and LiveData.
- Third party libraries such as RxJava/RxAndroid, Dagger2, Retrofit.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CD/CI).

Lots of stuff!! :sweat_smile:

Personally I have learned a lot through this course and making all these articles/summaries for each lesson that I will keep as reference for future times and avoid as much as possible this [(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/flipping-tables) moments. I would also like to please all the fellow students for their support and hope this serie of articles can help them as much as myself. And of course thanks to Udacity and Google for this opportunity.

So this is all by now. Hope see you on the second phase where we could enjoy the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).
