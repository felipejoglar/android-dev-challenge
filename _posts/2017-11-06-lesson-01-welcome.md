This lesson is just an introductory video to the Challenge program, in which they motivate us to participate and encourage us to share our thoughts and learnings in Slack as well at the forums in order to be elegible to the [nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) that comes after this course.

So this is **not a technical article**, instead I will try to explain my situation, motivation and goals towards this course.


## My personal approach

I actually have **some programming background and Android development experience** I got from taking the free Udacity Android courses and in fact I took the same course we are doing now about two years ago.

Just after completing that course, the opportunity came to me in the form of a contest at the university. It consisted in creating a [News Reader app](https://github.com/fjoglar/ETSIT-Noticias) that should take de RSS feed of the university news and show it in an app with settings, notifications and other kind of features. So I put the effort and applied to the contest, casually I won it and it *motivated* me to the point that I [rewrite the whole application from scratch](https://github.com/fjoglar/ETSIT-News) applying some patterns and best practices I've learned through the process.

Since then I found a full-time job (not Android dev related :disappointed:) and my time dedicated to my beloved platform decayed drastically. So this is why I applied to this challenge, to return to way of the mobile development, refresh the knowledge, networking with people who also loves developing Android and become a better programmer.


## Object of this repository

The objective of this [repository](https://github.com/fjoglar/android-dev-challenge) is to *document* my path through the challenge, this will serve as my personal notebook where I will summarize the contents, concepts, learnings and useful resources from the course and related to the stuff we learn.
